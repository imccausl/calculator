# Calculator
Go big or go home, right? This is a project exercise from thefreecodecamp.com's Front-End Developer Certification but I've kind of 
decided to add way more functionality than what is necessary to complete the project -- mainly accepting keyboard inputs and displaying
the entire expression on the 'screen' area. I take some of my functionality cues from the built-in calculator in Google search.

Furthermore, I use the math.js library for the evaluating the expressions so that I can avoid using 'eval', and because it's
a powerful library that allows me to play around with adding various functionalities befitting of a scientific calculator.

In addition to having a playground in which to practice JavaScript, I am also using design patterns such as
MVC in order to keep the code as clean and maintainable as possible. Feedback is always welcome on how I might attain this end better
than what my current implementation suggests.
