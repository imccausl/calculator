# Calculator
Go big or go home, right? This is a project exercise from thefreecodecamp.com's Front-End Developer Certification but I've kind of 
decided to add way more functionality than what is necessary to complete the project -- mainly accepting keyboard inputs and displaying
the entire expression on the 'screen' area. I take some of my functionality cues from the built-in calculator in Google search.

Furthermore, I use the math.js library for the evaluating the expressions so that I can avoid using 'eval', and because it's
a powerful library that allows me to play around with adding various functionalities befitting of a scientific calculator.

In addition to having a playground in which to practice JavaScript, I am also trying my damndest to utilize design patterns such as
MVC and (right now) PubSub (although I might refactor that logic a little bit as I continue learning about design patterns) in 
order to keep the code as clean and maintainable as possible. Feedback is always welcome on how I might attain this ends better
than what my current implementation suggests.

Finally, this project is unfinished as of November 20th, 2016 -- it is a work in progress. So if you DO try to use it,
it works, but you'll find all kinds of wonky behaviour while I iron out the bugs.

That's it! Thanks for checking out my code portfolio!
